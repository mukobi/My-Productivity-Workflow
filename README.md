# My-Productivity-Workflow
Documenting my tools and techniques for being productive.

## Tools

### Communication

#### Email: Gmail/Outlook

- Inbox 0: I try to keep my inboxes empty through regular scheduled emailing, snoozing emails, unsubscribing from things I don't truly need, and being efficient about my emailing
- Checking email can be (has been) very distracting, so I try to minimize it
  - Regular Inbox 0 review times: Morning (9:00 AM) and evening (8:00 PM)
  - I sometimes check emails during my work breaks, especially if I'm expecting important things or I'm in a communication-critical time (like the week before an important event I'm coordinating), but I try to avoid it and mostly only check at my designated Inbox 0 times
  - 5 minute rule: If an email will take more than 5 minutes to respond to or action on, I will save it for the next Inbox 0 time unless it's extremely critical and timely
