# My-Productivity-Workflow
Documenting my tools and techniques for being productive.

## Time

### Scheduled Pomodoro
ideas for breaks: listen to music with eyes closed, do nothing and think, do nothing and meditate, power nap, clean room, Duolingo, NSDR, note something

### Calendar

### Calendly

### Nirvana

### Signing-down
- Opposite of signing-up
- Can be both quitting things respectfully/gracefully and delegating responsibilities to others

### Caffeine
- Write my policy


## Information

### Dynalist

### Obsidian

### Docs

### Dyna is system 1, obs and docs sys 2


## Communication

### Email: Gmail/Outlook
- I just use Gmail for my personal email because it's common and has good integration with my Google account
- I just use Outlook for my school email because it's what Stanford set up all our emails for
- Inbox 0: I keep my inboxes empty through regular scheduled emailing, snoozing emails, unsubscribing from things I don't truly need, and being efficient about my emailing
- Checking email can be (has been) very distracting, so I try to minimize it
  - I regularly review my inbox and get to Inbox 0 in the morning (9:00 AM) and evening (8:00 PM) and optimally spending no more than 30 minutes on it at a time
  - I don't keep email tabs open in my browser outside Inbox 0 times (I used to keep pinned email tabs, but those were very distracting)
  - I sometimes check emails during my work breaks, especially if I'm expecting important things or I'm in a communication-critical time (like the week before an important event I'm coordinating), but I try to avoid it and mostly only check at my designated Inbox 0 times
  - 5 minute rule: If an email will take more than 5 minutes to respond to or action on, I will save it for the next Inbox 0 time unless it's extremely critical and timely
- Currently, even with these strategies, I think I spend way to much time sending/reading emails. To improve this, I'm making an effort to write low-effort emails (essentially making my register, language, brevity, and formality less like a letter and more like an instant message) and signing-down from things so that I have fewer responsibilities I need to be emailing about.

### Messenger

### Slack

### Sometimes Discord
