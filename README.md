Documenting my tools and techniques for being productive.

## Tools

### Communication

#### Email: Gmail/Outlook
- I just use Gmail for my personal email because it's common and has good integration with my Google account
- I just use Outlook for my school email because it's what Stanford set up all our emails for
- Inbox 0: I keep my inboxes empty through regular scheduled emailing, snoozing emails, unsubscribing from things I don't truly need, and being efficient about my emailing
- Checking email can be (has been) very distracting, so I try to minimize it
  - I regularly review my inbox and get to Inbox 0 in the morning (9:00 AM) and evening (8:00 PM) and optimally spending no more than 30 minutes on it at a time
  - I don't keep email tabs open in my browser outside Inbox 0 times (I used to keep pinned email tabs, but those were very distracting)
  - I sometimes check emails during my work breaks, especially if I'm expecting important things or I'm in a communication-critical time (like the week before an important event I'm coordinating), but I try to avoid it and mostly only check at my designated Inbox 0 times
  - 5 minute rule: If an email will take more than 5 minutes to respond to or action on, I will save it for the next Inbox 0 time unless it's extremely critical and timely
